# Subagent-Driven Development

Execute plan by dispatching a fresh implementer subagent per task, a task review (spec compliance + code quality) after each, and a broad whole-branch review at the end.

**Why subagents:** You delegate tasks to specialized agents with isolated context. By precisely crafting their instructions and context, you ensure they stay focused and succeed at their task. They should never inherit your session's context or history — you construct exactly what they need. This also preserves your own context for coordination work.

**Core principle:** Fresh subagent per task + task review (spec + quality) + broad final review = high quality, fast iteration

## Authority precedence

This playbook is a method, not an authority source. Before setup or dispatch,
resolve the execution contract in this order:

1. A validated, confirmed task card's explicit `Execution mode`, `Execution
   topology`, and `Delegation planning` tuple.
2. Explicit task constraints, including `no-commit`, `no-push`, write ownership,
   protected paths, review gates, and integration ownership.
3. This playbook's defaults, only where the confirmed contract is silent.

The playbook must never upgrade or downgrade the card. `plan-only` and
`single-writer` forbid implementation subagent writers. `fanout-in-card`
permits only writers named by the current card; `fanout-cross-card` is required
for separately authoritative cards. `parallel` permits parallel lanes, while
`worktree` permits isolated worktree lanes as well as parallel or single
execution. `Delegation planning: no` forbids delegation; `yes` permits it only
within the mode and topology ceiling.

An explicit no-commit constraint binds every implementer, fixer, integrator,
and reviewer. Commit-oriented steps below then use the no-commit diff path.
Write the resolved tuple and constraints at the top of the progress ledger
before dispatch. If they conflict, fail closed; never silently substitute this
playbook's sequential or commit defaults.

**Narration:** between tool calls, narrate at most one short line — the
ledger and the tool results carry the record.

**Continuous execution:** Do not pause to check in with your human partner between tasks. Execute all tasks from the plan without stopping. The only reasons to stop are: BLOCKED status you cannot resolve, ambiguity that genuinely prevents progress, or all tasks complete. "Should I continue?" prompts and progress summaries waste their time — they asked you to execute the plan, so execute it.

## When to Use

```dot
digraph when_to_use {
    "Have implementation plan?" [shape=diamond];
    "Tasks mostly independent?" [shape=diamond];
    "Stay in this session?" [shape=diamond];
    "subagent-driven-development" [shape=box];
    "executing-plans" [shape=box];
    "Manual execution or brainstorm first" [shape=box];

    "Have implementation plan?" -> "Tasks mostly independent?" [label="yes"];
    "Have implementation plan?" -> "Manual execution or brainstorm first" [label="no"];
    "Tasks mostly independent?" -> "Stay in this session?" [label="yes"];
    "Tasks mostly independent?" -> "Manual execution or brainstorm first" [label="no - tightly coupled"];
    "Stay in this session?" -> "subagent-driven-development" [label="yes"];
    "Stay in this session?" -> "executing-plans" [label="no - parallel session"];
}
```

**vs. Executing Plans (parallel session):**
- Same session (no context switch)
- Fresh subagent per task (no context pollution)
- Review after each task (spec compliance + code quality), broad review at the end
- Faster iteration (no human-in-loop between tasks)

## Setup

Apply the confirmed topology. For `worktree`, use
superpowers:using-git-worktrees to create or verify the isolated worktrees
named by the contract. For `parallel`, use isolated writers whose path
ownership cannot overlap. Never start implementation on a main/master branch
without explicit consent.

Conversation memory does not survive compaction. In real sessions,
controllers that lost their place have re-dispatched entire completed task
sequences — the single most expensive failure observed. Track progress in
a ledger file, not only in todos.

- Each plan owns a workspace: at skill start, run this skill's
  `scripts/sdd-workspace PLAN_FILE` — it prints the plan's git-ignored
  directory (`<repo-root>/.superpowers/sdd/<plan-basename>/`), home to
  every artifact for THIS plan: ledger, briefs, reports, review packages.
  Another plan's directory is never yours to read or write.
- Check for this plan's ledger at `<workspace>/progress.md`. If its first
  line names your plan file, tasks with a `Task <N>: complete` line are DONE
  — do not re-dispatch them; resume at the first task without one. A task
  whose last line is a fix round is mid-loop: resume the loop at the next
  round. A ledger whose first line names a different plan file — or a stray
  ledger at the old flat path `.superpowers/sdd/progress.md` — is another
  plan's progress: leave it in place and start your own, fresh.
- Create the ledger with its identity as the first line:
  `# SDD ledger — plan: <plan file path>`.
- Immediately record `Execution mode`, `Execution topology`, `Delegation
  planning`, commit policy, and every lane's worktree and write ownership. This
  authority block survives compaction and is checked before every re-dispatch.
- The ledger is your recovery map. For commit-authorized work, trust its commit
  identities and `git log`. Under no-commit, trust its package paths, hashes,
  three-part inventories, and retained worktrees; no Git history exists for
  those bytes.
- Never run `git clean -fdx` as a recovery or cleanup step. It destroys ignored
  scratch and, under no-commit, may destroy the only copy of reviewed bytes.

Read the plan once, note its context and Global Constraints, and create a
todo per task.

Before dispatching Task 1, scan the plan once for conflicts:

- tasks that contradict each other or the plan's Global Constraints
- anything the plan explicitly mandates that the review rubric treats as a
  defect (a test that asserts nothing, verbatim duplication of a logic block)

Present everything you find to your human partner as one batched question —
each finding beside the plan text that mandates it, asking which governs —
before execution begins, not one interrupt per discovery mid-plan. If the
scan is clean, proceed without comment. The review loop remains the net for
conflicts that only emerge from implementation.

## Model Selection

Use the least powerful model that can handle each role to conserve cost and increase speed.

**Mechanical implementation tasks** (isolated functions, clear specs, 1-2 files): use a fast, cheap model. Most implementation tasks are mechanical when the plan is well-specified.

**Integration and judgment tasks** (multi-file coordination, pattern matching, debugging): use a standard model.

**Architecture and design tasks**: use the most capable available model.
The final whole-branch review is one of these — dispatch it on the most
capable available model, not the session default.

**Review tasks**: choose the model with the same judgment, scaled to the
diff's size, complexity, and risk. A small mechanical diff does not need the
most capable model; a subtle concurrency change does. Scoped re-reviews of
small fix diffs take a cheap-to-mid tier.

**Fix-loop escalation (rounds 4-5)**: use a model at least one tier above
the implementer that got stuck.

**Always specify the model explicitly when dispatching a subagent.** An
omitted model inherits your session's model — often the most capable and
most expensive — which silently defeats this section.

**Turn count beats token price.** Wall-clock and context cost scale with how
many turns a subagent takes, and the cheapest models routinely take 2-3× the
turns on multi-step work — costing more overall. Use a mid-tier model as the
floor for reviewers and for implementers working from prose descriptions.
When the task's plan text contains the complete code to write, the
implementation is transcription plus testing: use the cheapest tier for
that implementer. Single-file mechanical fixes also take the cheapest tier.

**Task complexity signals (implementation tasks):**
- Touches 1-2 files with a complete spec → cheap model
- Touches multiple files with integration concerns → standard model
- Requires design judgment or broad codebase understanding → most capable model

## The Task Loop

Everything you paste into a dispatch prompt — and everything a subagent
prints back — stays resident in your context for the rest of the session
and is re-read on every later turn. Hand artifacts over as files.

### 1. Dispatch the implementer

Record BASE (`git rev-parse HEAD`) and the initial index/worktree status before
dispatching. Commit-based and no-commit review packages both need this baseline.

- **Task brief:** before dispatching an implementer, run this skill's
  `scripts/task-brief PLAN_FILE N` — it extracts the task's full text to a
  uniquely named file and prints the path. Compose the dispatch so the
  brief stays the single source of
  requirements. Your dispatch should contain: (1) one line on where this
  task fits in the project; (2) the brief path, introduced as "read this
  first — it is your requirements, with the exact values to use verbatim";
  (3) interfaces and decisions from earlier tasks that the brief cannot
  know; (4) your resolution of any ambiguity you noticed in the brief;
  (5) the report-file path and report contract. Exact values (numbers,
  magic strings, signatures, test cases) appear only in the brief. Never
  make a subagent read the whole plan file.
- **Report file:** name the implementer's report file after the brief
  (brief `…/task-N-brief.md` → report `…/task-N-report.md`) and put it in
  the dispatch prompt. The implementer writes the full report there and
  returns only status, commits or `none (no-commit)`, a one-line test summary,
  and concerns.
- A dispatch prompt describes one task, not the session's history. Do not
  paste accumulated prior-task summaries ("state after Tasks 1-3") into
  later dispatches — a real session's dispatch hit 42k chars of which 99%
  was pasted history. A fresh subagent needs its task, the interfaces it
  touches, and the global constraints. Nothing else.
- If an earlier task parked a finding in the area this task touches, carry
  a pointer to that ledger entry in the dispatch.
- Record the implementer's agent identity from the dispatch result —
  fix-loop rounds 1-3 resume this agent.
- Default to one implementation writer when the confirmed contract is silent.
  Parallel implementation is allowed only when a validated card authorizes a
  fanout execution mode plus `parallel` or `worktree` topology, and the ledger
  gives every lane non-overlapping write ownership.

### Parallel worktree lanes

For authorized `fanout-in-card` plus `worktree` execution, dispatch independent
lanes concurrently. Each dispatch carries the same card identity and authority
tuple plus only that lane's brief, exact worktree, write ownership, report path,
and commit policy. A lane stops before touching a shared manifest, central
registry, another lane's files, or any unassigned path.

Each lane records:

- lane and agent identity, BASE, worktree, and owned paths;
- status and test evidence;
- commit SHA range, or `commits: none (no-commit)`;
- tracked diff hash and exact untracked-file inventory;
- integration state: pending, integrated, reviewed, or blocked.

The main executor is the sole integrator. Fan in completed lanes one at a time,
verify paths against ownership, preserve pre-existing changes, apply or copy
the exact uncommitted diff into the integration worktree, then compare the
integrated bytes and diff hash with the lane artifact. Never use reset,
checkout, clean, or worktree deletion as integration. Run cross-lane tests only
after all required lane diffs are present.

Under no-commit, a review package contains all three byte inventories from the
integration worktree:

- tracked: complete `git diff --binary HEAD`, status/stat, and a package hash;
- untracked: exact path inventory plus a content hash for every file;
- explicitly owned ignored files: exact path inventory plus a content hash for
  every ignored file named by the task card or lane brief's owned-path
  allowlist. Never discover or package arbitrary ignored user files.

Do not use `HEAD~1` or a commit-only range: it would omit the changes being
reviewed. Task and final reviewers inspect this package and the ledger's
lane-integration records.

Template: [implementer-prompt.md](implementer-prompt.md)

### 2. Handle the report

Implementer subagents report one of four statuses. Handle each appropriately:

**DONE:** Generate the review package. When commits are authorized, use
`scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE BASE HEAD` (never `HEAD~1`). Under no-commit,
package the complete tracked diff plus untracked content/hash inventory as
described above. Then dispatch the task reviewer with the artifact path.

**DONE_WITH_CONCERNS:** The implementer completed the work but flagged doubts. Read the concerns before proceeding. If the concerns are about correctness or scope, address them before review. If they're observations (e.g., "this file is getting large"), note them and proceed to review.

**NEEDS_CONTEXT:** The implementer needs information that wasn't provided. Provide the missing context and re-dispatch.

**BLOCKED:** The implementer cannot complete the task. Assess the blocker:
1. If it's a context problem, provide more context and re-dispatch with the same model
2. If the task requires more reasoning, re-dispatch with a more capable model
3. If the task is too large, break it into smaller pieces
4. If the plan itself is wrong, escalate to the human

**Never** ignore an escalation or force the same model to retry without changes. If the implementer said it's stuck, something needs to change.

If the implementer asks questions — before starting or mid-task — answer
clearly and completely, provide additional context if needed, and don't
rush it into implementation.

### 3. Review the task

Per-task reviews are task-scoped gates. The broad review happens once, at the
final whole-branch review. Never skip the task review, and never accept a
report missing either verdict — spec compliance AND task quality are both
required. Implementer self-review never replaces the task review; both are
needed.

- Hand the reviewer its diff as a file. For commit-authorized work, run this skill's
  `scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE BASE HEAD` and pass the reviewer the file path
  it prints (or, without bash: `git log --oneline`, `git diff --stat`,
  and `git diff -U10` for the range, redirected to one uniquely named
  file). The output never enters your own context, and the reviewer sees
  the commit list, stat summary, and full diff with context in one Read
  call. Use the BASE you recorded before dispatching the implementer —
  never `HEAD~1`, which silently truncates multi-commit tasks. Never
  dispatch a task reviewer without a diff file. For no-commit work, pass the
  complete uncommitted package and lane-integration ledger described above.
- **Reviewer inputs:** the task reviewer gets three paths — the same brief
  file, the report file, and the review package — plus the global
  constraints that bind the task.
- The global-constraints block you hand the reviewer is its attention
  lens. Copy the binding requirements verbatim from the plan's Global
  Constraints section or the spec: exact values, exact formats, and the
  stated relationships between components ("same layout as X", "matches
  Y"). The reviewer's template already carries the process rules (YAGNI,
  test hygiene, review method) — the constraints block is for what THIS
  project's spec demands.
- Do not add open-ended directives like "check all uses" or "run race tests
  if useful" without a concrete, task-specific reason
- Do not ask a reviewer to re-run tests the implementer already ran on the
  same code — the implementer's report carries the test evidence
- Do not pre-judge findings for the reviewer — never instruct a reviewer to
  ignore or not flag a specific issue. If you believe a finding would be a
  false positive, let the reviewer raise it and adjudicate it in the review
  loop. If the prompt you are writing contains "do not flag," "don't treat X
  as a defect," "at most Minor," or "the plan chose" — stop: you are
  pre-judging, usually to spare yourself a review loop.
The task reviewer may report "⚠️ Cannot verify from diff" items — requirements
that live in unchanged code or span tasks. These do not block the rest of the
review, but you must resolve each one yourself before marking the task
complete: you hold the plan and cross-task context the reviewer
lacks. If you confirm an item is a real gap, treat it as a failed spec
review — it enters the fix loop with the other findings.

Template: [task-reviewer-prompt.md](task-reviewer-prompt.md)

### 4. The fix loop

The loop triggers when the review reports spec ❌, any Critical or Important
finding, or a ⚠️ item you confirmed as a real gap.

Before the loop starts, two routes leave it immediately:

- Record Minor findings in the progress ledger as you go
  (`Task <N>: minor (deferred): <one-liner>`), and point the final
  whole-branch review at that list so it can triage which must be fixed
  before merge. A roll-up nobody reads is a silent discard. Minor findings
  never enter the loop.
- A finding labeled plan-mandated — or any finding that conflicts with
  what the plan's text requires — is the human's decision, like any plan
  contradiction: present the finding and the plan text, ask which governs.
  Do not dismiss the finding because the plan mandates it, and do not
  dispatch a fix that contradicts the plan without asking.
Everything else enters the loop. A fix round is one fix dispatch plus one
scoped re-review. Five rounds maximum per task:

**Rounds 1-3 — resume the original implementer.** Send it the open findings
verbatim. Its context is intact: it knows the task, the code, and its own
choices. If your harness cannot send another message to a live subagent,
dispatch a fresh implementer carrying the brief path, the report-file path,
and the findings — the report file is the persistent memory either way.

**Rounds 4-5 — dispatch a fresh implementer on a more capable model** (per
Model Selection), with the brief path, the report-file path, the open
findings, and this framing: "A prior implementer attempted this task
[N] times; you own it now. Read the report file for what was tried." A loop
that survives three resumes usually means the implementer cannot see its
own problem — fresh eyes and a capability bump in one move.

**Every round, either way:** the implementer fixes, re-runs the tests
covering the amended code, appends its fix report to the same report file,
and returns the short contract. Before re-dispatching the reviewer, confirm
the fix report contains the covering tests, the command run, and the
output; dispatch the re-review once all three are present. Name the
covering test files in the fix message — a one-line fix does not need the
whole suite.

**The re-review is scoped.** For commit-authorized work, run
`scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE FIX_BASE HEAD`, where FIX_BASE is the head
the previous review saw. For no-commit work, record the previous package path,
package hash, and three-part byte inventory before the fix; then build a new
package after the fix and pass both package paths, both hashes, and the exact
changed-path inventory to the re-reviewer. A no-commit re-review never uses a
commit range. Dispatch [re-review-prompt.md](re-review-prompt.md) with the
findings list, brief, report file, and these scoped artifacts. The re-reviewer
verdicts each finding ADDRESSED or NOT ADDRESSED and flags new breakage in the
fix bytes only. New Critical/Important breakage joins the open findings list.
Out-of-scope observations go to the ledger as deferred minors; they never
extend the loop.

**After each round,** append to the ledger:
`Task <N>: fix round <R>/5 (<X> addressed, <Y> open — <finding one-liners>; commits <a7>..<b7>)`

Under no-commit, replace the commit range with
`diff <before-hash>..<after-hash>; commits none`.

Never fix findings yourself in the controller session — your context stays
clean for coordination, and controller fixes skip review.

**The breaker.** When round 5's re-review still leaves findings open, stop
dispatching. Adjudicate each open finding yourself — you hold the plan and
the cross-task context the reviewer lacks:

**A confirmed task-card blocking finding is never parkable.** A finding that
shows the implementation violates a requirement, boundary, stop condition, or
acceptance criterion in the validated confirmed task card must remain open.
Stop, mark the task BLOCKED, and ask for a fix or a newly confirmed authority
change. Never mark that task complete, even at the round cap. Task-card
authority takes precedence over the general parking cases below.

- **The reviewer is wrong, or the point is contestable:** park it —
  `Task <N>: parked — <finding> — ruling: <why the code stands>`. The final
  review sees both sides.
- **Real, but nothing downstream builds on it:** park it the same way, with
  a ruling that says it's real and deferred.
- **Real and load-bearing** — a later task builds on it, or it reveals a
  plan defect: STOP. Append `Task <N>: BLOCKED — <reason>` and report to
  your human partner with the finding, the plan text it collides with, and
  the fix history. Parking a structural failure lets every dependent task
  build on it and hands the final review a problem it cannot fix either.

Adjudicate only at the cap. Adjudicating earlier to end a loop is
pre-judging with a different name. Every adjudication is a ledger entry —
a silent discard is forbidden.

### 5. Complete the task

Before any completion entry, re-check open and parked findings against the
validated confirmed task card. If any finding is blocking under that card,
remove any parked/completed label, mark the task BLOCKED, and stop. A round cap
does not weaken confirmed authority.

When the review comes back clean — or every eligible non-card finding is
parked with a ruling at the cap and no confirmed-card blocking finding remains
— append the completion line to the ledger in the same
message as your other bookkeeping:

- `Task <N>: complete (commits <base7>..<head7>, review clean)`
- `Task <N>: complete (commits <base7>..<head7>, <K> parked)` after a
  tripped breaker

Under no-commit, record `Task <N>: complete (diff <hash>, commits none,
review clean)` and keep the lane worktree until the main executor confirms
byte-for-byte integration.

Then mark the todo complete and move on. Never move to the next task while
the review has open Critical/Important issues that are neither fixed nor
parked-with-ruling at the cap.

## Final Review

For commit-authorized work, the final whole-branch review gets a package too: run
`scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE MERGE_BASE HEAD` (MERGE_BASE = the commit the
branch started from, e.g. `git merge-base main HEAD`) and include the
printed path in the final review dispatch, so the final reviewer reads
one file instead of re-deriving the branch diff with git commands. Dispatch
on the most capable available model (see Model Selection), using
superpowers:requesting-code-review's
[code-reviewer.md](../requesting-code-review/code-reviewer.md). Point it at
the ledger's deferred-minor and parked lines so it can triage which must be
fixed before merge.

Under no-commit, instead generate the complete package from the integration
worktree's tracked changes, untracked files, and explicitly owned ignored-file
allowlist. Include content hashes for all three inventories plus every lane's
diff hash and integration record. A clean commit range is not evidence that
uncommitted lane work was integrated.

If the final whole-branch review returns findings, dispatch ONE fix subagent
with the complete findings list — not one fixer per finding.
Per-finding fixers each rebuild context and re-run suites; a real
session's final-review fix wave cost more than all its tasks combined.
Then run exactly one scoped re-review of the fix wave. Commit-authorized work
uses `scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE FIX_BASE HEAD` over the fix range.
No-commit work captures before/after package paths and hashes plus the exact
tracked, untracked, and explicitly owned ignored-file inventory delta; it does
not use a commit range. Dispatch
[re-review-prompt.md](re-review-prompt.md) with the corresponding artifacts.
Adjudicate any residual findings as in the task loop's breaker: confirmed-card
blocking findings remain non-parkable and block completion; only eligible
non-card findings may be parked with rulings. There is no second fix wave —
residual load-bearing findings surface to your human partner when
finishing-a-development-branch presents the options.

## Finish

When the final whole-branch review is clean and fixes are integrated, follow
the confirmed cleanup and commit policy. Commit-authorized work may delete this
plan's scratch workspace after history is verified. Under no-commit, keep all
lane worktrees and artifacts until the main executor confirms integration and
explicitly authorizes cleanup; Git history is not the record in that mode.
Sibling directories belong to other plans and are always left alone.

Use superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch.

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Close enough on spec compliance" | Reviewer found spec gaps = not done. Fix or hit the cap and adjudicate — those are the only exits. |
| "I'll fix it myself, dispatching is overhead" | Controller fixes pollute your context and skip review. Resume the implementer. |
| "One more round will converge" | Past the cap, rounds don't converge — the failure is structural. Adjudicate and route. |
| "The reviewer will just find something new anyway" | Scoped re-reviews verify fixes; they cannot wander. New findings on untouched code go to the ledger, not the loop. |
| "This finding is obviously wrong, I'll drop it" | You adjudicate only at the cap, and every ruling is a ledger entry. Silent discards are forbidden. |
| "The fix was small, skip the re-review" | Unreviewed fixes are how regressions land. Every round ends with a scoped re-review. |
| "Reviews slow the loop down" | The loop without reviews is just unverified churn. Reviews are the loop's brakes and steering. |
| "Ledger bookkeeping is overhead" | The ledger is what survives compaction. Controllers without one have re-dispatched entire completed task sequences. |

## Example Workflow

```
You: I'm using Subagent-Driven Development to execute this plan.

[Setup: worktree verified]
[Read plan file once: docs/superpowers/plans/feature-plan.md]
[Resolve workspace: scripts/sdd-workspace docs/superpowers/plans/feature-plan.md — no ledger inside, fresh start]
[Create todos for all tasks]

Task 1: Hook installation script

[Run task-brief for Task 1; dispatch implementer with brief + report paths + context]

Implementer: "Before I begin - should the hook be installed at user or system level?"

You: "User level (~/.config/superpowers/hooks/)"

Implementer: [Later]
  - Implemented install-hook command
  - Added tests, 5/5 passing
  - Self-review: Found I missed --force flag, added it
  - Committed

[Run review-package PLAN_FILE BASE HEAD; dispatch task reviewer with the printed path]
Task reviewer: Spec ✅ - all requirements met, nothing extra.
  Strengths: Good test coverage, clean. Issues: None. Task quality: Approved.

[Ledger: Task 1: complete (commits a1b2c3d..d4e5f6a, review clean)]

Task 2: Recovery modes

[Run task-brief for Task 2; dispatch implementer with brief + report paths + context]

Implementer: [No questions]
  - Added verify/repair modes
  - 8/8 tests passing
  - Committed

[Run review-package PLAN_FILE BASE HEAD; dispatch task reviewer with the printed path]
Task reviewer: Spec ❌:
  - Missing: Progress reporting (spec says "report every 100 items")
  Issues (Important): Magic number (100)

[Fix round 1: resume the implementer with both findings]
Implementer: Added progress reporting, extracted PROGRESS_INTERVAL constant.
  Re-ran test/recovery.test.js — 10/10 passing. Fix report appended.

[Commit-authorized example: run review-package PLAN_FILE FIX_BASE HEAD;
 dispatch scoped re-review]
Re-reviewer: Missing progress reporting — ADDRESSED (src/recovery.js:41).
  Magic number — ADDRESSED (src/recovery.js:7). New breakage: none.
  Verdict: all findings addressed.

[Ledger: Task 2: fix round 1/5 (2 addressed, 0 open; commits d4e5f6a..b7c8d9e)]
[Ledger: Task 2: complete (commits d4e5f6a..b7c8d9e, review clean)]

...

[After all tasks]
[Run review-package PLAN_FILE MERGE_BASE HEAD; dispatch final code-reviewer, most capable model]
Final reviewer: All requirements met. Deferred minors triaged: none block merge.

[Delete this plan's workspace — the record now lives in git]

Done! Using superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch.
